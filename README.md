Oh wow — just stumbled out of Ask Sadece Bir An, and it's like... that feeling when you wake up from a nap in a laundry basket. So many colors and feelings swirling like the popcorn butter on my fingers. That opening scene, was anyone else nearly swallowing their gum?? Noise everywhere, and my back is sore from those seats (could they make them any closer to a medieval torture contraption??).

The director almost felt like—what’s that phrase?—leaving the cake out in the rain. So melty and confusing but somehow so delicious. Actor in the second scene—did you see how his eyes glinted like a ferret at midnight? It almost made me forget there’s popcorn crumbs sticking to my jeans.

>Splash of light and whispers when they were dancing. Wait, was that a dance? Or some kind of flailing ritual? Still, I wanted to join. The soundtrack felt like it was creeping into my bones, some parts felt like a hug, and others—like the clasps on your old suitcase snapping open mid-stride. Didn’t someone ask if they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later? That rhythm, could trap you in a trance like gluing your hand to a gorilla, somehow comforting, somehow alarming.

Did that scene even make sense? With the balloons...and the rainbows out of place like they were abandoned by a weather Google maps error. I think my glasses were trying to run away by then. The anticipation though, like standing before a vending machine where every item has fallen to the floor except your snack. You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   twice, or thrice, maybe invite your existential crises friends?

Stray teardrop on my cheek, or someone spilled their drink? Wasn't sure, but coming away clearer, fuzzier? The main character, she, her expression. Like she just let go of carrying an invisible elephant. And my back now, ouch. Is it empathizing or protesting?

int main() {
    cout << But what does it mean? << endl;
    return spaghetti;
